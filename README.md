# Lecture Series
-----------------

This series was created to address questions from various members of the OU Physics and Astronomy department. This will not give you a comprehensive knowledge of all things Linux/coding, but is aimed to give you a working knowledge of various systems. 

The series is aimed at 5 x 30min lectures with working examples and slides for interactive sessions.

## Each day has an `outline` file and a `README.md`. The `README.md` explains what each file and dir do. The outline details what the lecture is covering
