# Lecture outline
---------------------

Linux
Everything is a file

Different flavours (ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL)
So if you want to modify something, just edit the file

Programs are just a collection of files
In a place your computer knows where to look

So we will talk about basic commands and then how install your own
program

terminal vs shell....different shells (Bash/ksh and csh/zsh/tcsh)

cd ls cp mv echo export which
--- try using the basic commands walkthrough
find sed awk 

These basic commands are just files found within a certain directory
(use which to find them)
The directory is specified via PATH
Any directory found on path is searched for executables

so lets install a program without root
remember everything is a file in a certain location

open installingYourOwnProgram.sh and follow along
this is called compiling from source
set INSTALL_LOCAL to a location you want to install programs at (~/programs/)
walk through file

so now we just need to update your path to point at this location
now we have a working python. You can follow this same logic for other languages

next to get onto the nhn systems

ssh username@login.nhn.ou.edu <- works anywhere
ssh username@gradlab.nhn.ou.edu <- works on campus and at local ISP

once inside you can go to a certain machine via ssh bohr
if you have a personal workstation you can ssh directly to it
ssh username@computer.nhn.ou.edu

use ssh -XY to get GUI

good for quick options

better option use vnc

on host user vncserver

then on client use vncviewer -via host host:1

local -> remote
scp local username@host:remote
remote -> local 
scp username@host:remote local
